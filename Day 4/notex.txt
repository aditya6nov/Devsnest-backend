// How internet works and rest and intro to nodejs

How internet works:


// Protocols(sets the rules of data package)

- tcp/ip -> transports data (static file , index.html)
- http/https -> web access  ()
- rtp -> live video streaming VOIP calls (youtube live streaming)


////
// Application programming interface

Set of programming codes that enables data transmission between one software product and another

// how api works
 
 web app browser = (reqt/response)= internet = api = web server = database

// three approaches to API release policies

1. private: The API is only for use internally. This gives companies the most control over their API
2. partner: The API is shared with specific business partners. This can provide additional revenue streams without compromising qualities
3. Public: The API available to everyone. This allows third parties to develop apps that interact with your API and can be a source for innovation

// REST( representable state transfer)

- simple and standard ( )
- scalable and stateless ( json used thus stateless)
- high performance and can be cached( performance high because browser can unerstand js, json thus could be cached)

// RESt API and CRUD
Create -> POST
Read   -> GET
Update -> PUT
Delete -> DELETE

// Request 

header   ( it act as key for objects)
param/body
operations  endpoint

// response 

header ( came from which route, is everything ok or not) 
json (actaul thing is written in json)


/// 

//node.js
node.js makes api , so above diagram is valid for node.js

-- whywe use node.js
- js is there , json is there, thus nodejs is used
- frontend developer could also make rest api
- as in js thus event loop is used
