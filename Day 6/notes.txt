Event loop and async programming

javascript was made for browsers only, browser has least memory and space, so we cant use more than one thread in browsers, specially in older days
Earlier we were not having any method in which we could haveuse full capacity of system for memory for alotting to websites.
Nowadays we could use multithreading on frontend part.But still we need to work on single thread for websites.
Thats why the concept of event loop came into picture


// event loop

Event loop is nothing but an algorithm that handles async nature of javascript

//Async nature of javascript
 
Whatsoever heavy task are there if we keep them on hault so that whatsoever are light task could be executed and until then we could get response from heavy tasks.

// What is javascript

A single threaded, non blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.

Single threaded: it works on single thread, it dont have access to whole system's power, i.e have much less power
Non-blocking: No process is blocked
Concurrent: Could work in parallel in some sense

// what javascript have :

Call Stack, An Event loop , A callback queue , some other apis , and stuff

// V8 - an engine which compiles js and it was developed by google
It have Call Stack And a Heap only

Heap: where memory is getting alocated
Stack: where executation is happening

// The Call Stack
one thread == one call stack === one thing at a time

/// java script components:

// web APIs - setTimeout, setInterval, event listener - they are provided by websites and are not part of javascript , so that we could treat them as normal apis - so that it could be considered that these are slow things and these are time consuming things
web APIs have separate storage eg: rest apis have separate storage
// call stack
// callback queue
// event loop

-- whenever there are any rest api then they are stored somewhere
--- when they are ready then they are pushed into callback queue
-- but event loop keeps executing for checking if we have something in queue but not in stack then it is being pushed to stack for execution
